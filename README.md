# now you are ready to go

1- fork the github repo and inside folder (school-admin) run:

# npm install

2- cd into client folder and run:

# yarn install 

# note

i used Yarn for react app it is faster and better but for loopback they are using NPM in their docs so i used it.

* once your done from installation just in main folder (school-admin) run:

# npm run dev

the app will launch and enjoy ;)
